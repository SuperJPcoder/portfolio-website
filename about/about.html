        I am <strong>Priyank Jhaveri</strong>, a pre-final year student pursuing B. Tech in IT at
        <a href="https://vjti.ac.in" target="_blank">VJTI, Mumbai</a>. I'm passionate about coding, science math and engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the student placement coordinator at
        <a href="https://vjti.ac.in/training-and-placement-office/" target="_blank">TPO-VJTI</a> and have served as the Joint
        Gen Sec of
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coc_vjti" target="_blank">CoC - Community of Coders, VJTI</a>. To
        unleash my fun side, I have also been the marketing head at
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pratibimbvjti" target="_blank">Pratibimb</a>, VJTI's cultural club.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live the present and enjoy doing the work I take up (questioning my degree lol), making all of it much
        easier and fun.
        I love combining things from multiple domains to come up with creative ideas and solutions.
        I think with a high-level view and waaaay out of the box for research, algorithms, and projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides being smart, I'm
        <span id="traits-container">
          <span id="traits">polite</span>
        </span>,
        maintaining a very good rapport with everyone (all of it is validated by my friends and classmates!)
      </p>
      <p>
        And well, I’m a leader, confident and speaking up for all. Some actions led me to be called
        <strong>"revolution✊"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh and yes, good at time management and planning.
      </p>
      <h2>Things I’m Working to Fix:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning to say no to people, trying not to please everyone around me</li>
        <li>Adapting super fast to changing environments and learning stuff in a flash</li>
        <li>Thinking less (I’m an overthinker)</li>
      </ul>
