        I live the present and enjoy doing the work I take up (questioning my degree), making all of it much
        easier and fun. âœ¨
        I love combining things from multiple domains to come up with creative ideas and solutions.
        I think with a high-level view and waaaay out of the box for research, algorithms, and projects.

      <!-- <h2>Personality Traits</h2> -->
      <p>
        Besides being smart, I'm

      </p>
      <!-- <h2>Leadership</h2> -->
      <p>
        And well, Iâ€™m a leader, confident and speaking up for all. Some actions led me to be called

      </p>
      <!-- <h2>Time Management</h2> -->
      <p>
        Oh and yes, good at time management and planning.

      <h2>Things Iâ€™m Working to Fix:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning to say no to people, trying not to please everyone around me.</li>
        <li>Adapting super fast to changing environments and learning stuff in a flash.</li>
        <li>Thinking less (Iâ€™m an overthinker).</li>
